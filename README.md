# Breakout Game

The Breakout Game is a game created to master OOP and Turtle graphics.

## Features

**Lives System**: Implementing a system where the player starts with a certain number of lives, and they lose a life each time the ball touches the bottom of the screen. The remaining lives are displayed on the screen.
**Scoreboard**: Keeping track of the player's score as they break bricks and progress through the game. The current score is displayed prominently on the screen so the player can see their progress.
**Brick Layout**: Designing levels with 42 bricks arranged in different patterns and configurations. Each row of bricks has a specific position, color and score.
**Ball Speed Increase**: Gradually increasing the speed of the ball each time it bounces off a surface, adding a layer of difficulty as the game progresses.
